## History

HTLA was conceived as a model school for the 21st Century by education entrepreneur Roberta Weintraub in partnership with the Los Angeles Unified School District, a group of leading high-tech firms and nonprofit foundations. A replication site of [High Tech High in San Diego](http://www.hightechhigh.org/schools/HTH/), HTLA became the nation's first charter school on the campus of another public school, Birmingham High, and opened the 2002-2003 school year in temporary quarters. The current state-of-the-art facility opened to students in time for the 2004-2005 school year. On July 1, 2008, HTLA became an independent California charter school. As of 2012, HTLA is home to 366 students in grades 9-12 including 66 graduating, college-bound seniors.

Innovative features include performance-based assessment, shared planning and meeting time for staff, state-of-the-art technical facilities for project-based learning, internships and connections to the community. Accredited by the Western Association of Schools and Colleges, in 2007 we were honored as a California Distinguished High School.

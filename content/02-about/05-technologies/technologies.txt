This website runs on [Kirby CMS](http://www.getkirby.com/), a PHP content management system that supports the use of markdown.

We chose to make use of vectors (SVGs), rather than standard images where possible to improve page speed, and keep the website looking sharp even on newer high-pixel-density displays. Any images used throughout the site are also complemented by an additional copy of the image that is double the size, to account for those HiDPI displays.

Team 4's website is cross-browser compatible, so it runs on all major web browsers, and supports a wide range of operating systems. Some of the compatible web browsers include: Google Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and even Internet Explorer 8+. Additionally, the website is responsive, so users have a great experience on desktop _and_ mobile devices.

The design for this website was inspired by other popular minimal websites, such as [Sam Soffes's Blog](http://soff.es/), [GitHub](http://www.github.com/), and [Apple](http://www.apple.com/). The main focus of the redesigned website is to keep ther website clean, uncluttered, and easy to navigate. As a result, the website ends up with fewer errors and increased browser compatibility and responsiveness.

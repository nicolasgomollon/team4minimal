In 2006, High Tech Los Angeles joined the FIRST organization to provide an intriguing hands-on experience not only for students with a prime interest in science, technology, engineering, and math, but also for students who want to work in a &ldquo;business-like&rdquo; atmosphere. When registering, our school was given the opportunity to choose a retired team number. This is when **FIRST Team 4, &ldquo;Team 4 ELEMENT&rdquo;** was established. **&ldquo;ELEMENT&rdquo;** is an acronym that stands for _**E**ngineering_, _**L**eadership_, _**E**ntrepreneurship_, _**M**entoring_, _**E**ducation_, _**N**etworking_, and _**T**eamwork_. Team 4 ELEMENT is represented by the Phoenix, and our colors are turquoise and black.

On Team 4 ELEMENT, students do not only work in a department and contribute to the final product at the end of Build Season, but also participate in a number of different outreach activities in the community. Read more about this on the [outreach](/outreach) page.

A Team 4 ELEMENT robotics team member not only comes out with the skills to build a robot to accomplish a generally difficult task, but with skill sets that are applicable in daily life, including project management, teamwork, time management, and marketing skills.

The team motto is _&ldquo;Igniting the Flames of Passion.&rdquo;_

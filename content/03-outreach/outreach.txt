## Taste of Encino

In 2011, we went to the Taste of Encino. At the event, volunteers had the opportunity to spread the FIRST Robotics message to our community. We had a chance to talk about our own team and tell people what we have accomplished in the few years we have been established. We got to show them our robot and we even let some children who were interested in robotics try and maneuver the robot themselves. All together, we all had fun just communicating to many people who had taken interest in FIRST robotics and our team.

## Operation Gratitude

In November 2012, we went to the military base on Victory Boulevard for Operation Gratitude. Operation Gratitude is the assembly of care packages. Care packages are boxes that have items for the troops donated by various people and companies. We sorted candy and assembled boxes full of the items to send to the troops. We had our team arrive at two different shifts during the day. We were there from about when they opened to when they closed the assembly. We believe by assembling the care packages we would be helping some troops wherever they were.

## House of Ruth (Toy Drive)

From November 1 - December 14 2012, we collected toys and books from the students of our school. We then took those toys and books and donated them to the House of Ruth, a homeless center for women and children. Our lead mentor, Mr. B, dressed up as Santa Claus and gave the children the donated toys and books.

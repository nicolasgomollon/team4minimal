## 2013: Ultimate Ascent

Ultimate Ascent is the 2013 FIRST Robotics Competition game, where robots play a game similar to Frisbee Disc Golf. Robots pickup, track vision targets, and shoot Frisbees into one of the three different positioned goals. They then attempt to climb up a pyramid to gain extra points. They can even score into a special goal located on the top of the pyramid.

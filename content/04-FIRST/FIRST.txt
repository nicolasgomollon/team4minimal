**&ldquo;For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology&rdquo;**

</div>

[FIRST](http://www.usfirst.org/) is a non-profit organization with the mission to inspire high school students in math, science and technology. It was founded by Dean Kamen in 1989 and has since grown to more than 4,000 teams, and has spread to other countries such as Canada, Brazil, England, and Israel. FIRST also promotes the philosophy of gracious professionalism, a term used to describe a code of behavior which values community, promotes quality in work, and emphasizes respectful behavior toward others.

In each [FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC)](http://www.usfirst.org/roboticsprograms/frc), teams from around the world compete in a game created by FIRST. The rules of the game are revealed to the teams in January, in an event that kicks off build season. Build season continues for six more weeks, at the end of which the robots are shipped to competition sites.

## 2013: Ultimate Ascent

Ultimate Ascent is the 2013 FIRST Robotics Competition game, where robots play a game similar to Frisbee Disc Golf. Robots pickup, track vision targets, and shoot Frisbees into one of the three different positioned goals. They then attempt to climb up a pyramid to gain extra points. They can even score into a special goal located on the top of the pyramid.

## 2012: Rebound Rumble

Rebound Rumble is the 2012 FIRST Robotics Competition game, which is played on a 27 by 54 foot field (basketball court), with carpet flooring. The game is played by two alliances: red and blue. Each alliance consists of three different FRC teams. Each alliance has to score as many points as possible, as well as defended their four basketball hoops in matches that are 2 minutes and 15 seconds long. In the last 30 seconds of the match, each alliance has the opportunity to score &ldquo;coopertition&rdquo; points by balancing on their alliance's bridge or on the &ldquo;coopertition bridge.&rdquo; These &ldquo;coopertition&rdquo; points are used for seed rankings, which makes them very useful for ranking high at the competition.

## 2011: Logomotion

Logomotion is the 2011 FIRST Robotics Competition game, where robots place inner tubes (in the shapes of the FIRST logo) on racks to gain points. They earn extra points if they form different patterns of the shapes, including the formation of the FIRST logo. The endgame is to deploy &ldquo;minibots&rdquo; to climb a tower.

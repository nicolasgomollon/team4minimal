Although Team 4 students are studying for finals next week, we managed to squeeze in some team bonding! Secret Santa on Wednesday was a huge success as everyone got wonderful, hilarious gifts. 

The final pieces for the Drive Base have been machined and everything is off to the electronics department.

The Toy Drive is coming to a close as well. Next week is the last opportunity to get in the final donations to the homeless children at the House of Ruth. Team 4 will be going to see the children and deliver them on the 18th.

Only a few weeks left until kickoff! Enjoy your break everyone!

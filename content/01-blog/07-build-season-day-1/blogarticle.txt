If her prototype is successful, she believes the gear system may be applicable to other things needed for the robot. Way to go, Sidney! The other climbing prototypes are coming along and should be finished by the end of the week.

The shooter and disc grabber prototypes seem to be successful so far. They're still in their early stages, but team members are confident they'll be finished soon.

A small group worked on flashing the cRIO, updating all the software, and writing basic code. The basic drive code is complete, and as for the other tasks,
